.Sh NAME
tcvt - two column virtual terminal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtcvt\fP \fIprogram options\fP
.PP
\fBoptcvt\fP \fIprogram options\fP
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The two column virtual terminal emulates a virtual terminal inside another virtual terminal.
The emulated virtual terminal is twice as tall and half as wide as the original terminal.
The upper half of the virtual terminal goes to the left and the lower half goes to the right of the original terminal.
An \fBANSI\fP terminal is emulated.
Neither program takes any options.
All arguments are forwarded to the called program.

While \fBtcvt\fP splits does this conversion unconditionally, the \fBoptcvt\fP can be used with smaller terminals.
It will only invoke \fBtcvt\fP, if the terminal is wide enough and otherwise simply exec the passed program.
.Sh BUGS
Not all \fBANSI\fP terminal features are emulated.
If you experience rendering issues, you can export the environment variable \fBTCVT_DEVEL\fP.
It causes \fBtcvt\fP to crash upon seeing an unimplemented character sequence.
The error message includes the unrecognized sequence.
